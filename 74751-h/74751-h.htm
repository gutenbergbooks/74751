<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Francis Bacon</span> it was who said, “Prefaces are great wastes of time, and
tho’ they seem to proceed of modesty, they are bravery.” It is
necessary, however, in the present instance to make a stand against the
somewhat sweeping convictions of the Elizabethan master. The call of
Youth in India is a hot young call, trumpeting down the ages through a
maze of polytheistic tribute, and emerging in the twentieth century with
some of its original clearness of sound drowned by a Gargantuan thunder
of Western drums. The Indian poet of to-day is torn, like the Indian
painter, between admiration for Western models and a desire to mould
himself thereon, and an inherent Indian tradition that runs in his veins
and will not be denied. Indeed, it is pity to deny it. Sir Edmund Gosse
persuaded Sarojini Naidu to tear up her poems about English life and to
write of her own Indian bazaars and cities, villages and festivals, for
which persuasion we are indeed indebted to Sir Edmund. We of the West do
not want from the East poetic edifices built upon a foundation<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_10">{10}</a></span> of Yeats
and Shelley and Walt Whitman. We want genuine Taj Mahals and Juma
Masjids, cameos of rural sweetness and the hopes of faithful hearts. We
want to hear the flute of Krishna as Radha heard it, to fall under the
spell of the blue god “in the lotus-heart of dreams.” For there is much
to learn from the melody of Eastern thought. It is, perhaps, a minor
melody born of the mating of Love and Death, but it has its seed in an
innate spiritual rapture that no Western veneer can wholly cover.</p>

<p>In the bulk of Indian poetry religious feeling predominates, as is only
natural in a country of many but steadfast faiths.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ind">“To act, to think, to feel aright until<br></span>
<span class="i0">He knows his will as one with Allah’s will.”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">Subjugation of the Self leading to a merging of that Self with God.
India writes largely from the “Inner Vision.” This disallows of foreign
influence, but the poet is necessarily inspired as well by an everyday
atmosphere which he enriches from the strength of his own perception.
The steps of the bathing-ghâts in Calcutta may be of Sheffield
cast-iron, but the country that could produce a Taj Mahal&mdash;“stone turned
into a dream,” D. G. Mukerji calls it&mdash;will never lose the innate
artistic vision of her soul. So the creative prayers of this mighty
cosmopolitan multitude surge upwards in a song of glory till they reach
the stars. Love of life is love of art<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_11">{11}</a></span> because life is art and art is
life. We chase after fleeting perfection, a rosy cloud, a glint of
eternity in a lily-pool, a drop of dew trembling on a flower-petal,
moments of heaven in worlds of chaos. To catch a mood of Nature and
transfer it to paper; to wring from the heart of an instrument one swift
emotional phase after another: is it futile? is it useless?</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ind">“Am I one of the trees in the night,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or are the trees human beings?”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">asks Harindranath Chattopadhyaya in one of his poems not published here,
echoing the cry of Li Po:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ind">“Chuang Chou in a dream became a butterfly<br></span>
<span class="i0">And the butterfly became Chuang Chou at waking:<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which was the real, the butterfly or the man?”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In Indian poetry, the mystic element shines through the outer decorative
aspect.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ind">“Our dreams and longings cover deeper dreams<br></span>
<span class="i0">And longings in the silence far away.”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">We are roused from the beautiful lyrical lilt of Chattopadhyaya and of
his sister, Sarojini Naidu, by the thunder of Muhammad Iqbal’s
persuasive eloquence. He is a barrister-at-law at Lahore, an active
Moslem opposed to Platonic illusion and non-progressive idealism.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ind">“Plato, the prime ascetic and sage,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was one of that ancient flock of sheep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">His Pegasus went astray in the darkness of philosophy<br></span>
<span class="i0">And galloped over the mountains of Being.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He was so fascinated by the Ideal<br></span>
<span class="i0">That he made head, eye, and ear of no account.”<br></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_12">{12}</a></span></div></div>
</div>

<p>Whether one agrees with his outlook or not, the fact remains that one
cannot fail to be stirred by the intensely fiery spirit of Iqbal’s
rhetorical writing. He is a leader. He sweeps everything before him like
a great wind swirling through a forest of pines. He would re-create
Islam, an active, non-Imperialistic, non-sensual Islam. In his own
words, he is “the voice of the poet of To-morrow.” As Mr. R. A.
Nicholson (his translator) says, the book “Asrar-i-Khudi” (Secrets of
the Self), from which I have taken the extracts, “presents certain
obscurities which no translation can entirely remove.” That is, of
course, to European readers or to those not conversant with Persian
poetry. For the book was originally written in Persian.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ind">“Although the language of Hind is sweet as sugar,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet sweeter is the fashion of Persian speech.”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">He is an inspiring philosopher.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ind">“Thou art fire: fill the world with thy glow!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Make others burn with thy burning!<br></span>

<span class="idtts">. . . . . .<br></span>

<span class="i0">Up, and re-inspire every living soul!”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>I have spoken of the Youth of India, but the contributors to this volume
range in age from the twenties to the seventies. There is little need
for me to speak of Rabindranath Tagore. Mr. Edward Thompson (to whom I
am indebted for the three translations) has acted in a Boswellian
capacity, and the poet is as well known<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_13">{13}</a></span> in England as are the great
poets of our own nationality. I would draw attention, however, to the
beautiful concluding lines of “Urvasi”:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ind">“On the night of full moon, when the world brims with laughter,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Memory, from somewhere far away, pipes a flute that brings unrest,<br></span>
<span class="i4">The tears gush out!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet in that weeping of the spirit Hope wakes and lives;<br></span>
<span class="i4">Ah, Unfettered One!”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">The flute-call of memory bringing restlessness and a strange peace on
its liquid cadences. And a dimness of tears to stir the dust of Hope to
life. “Ah, Unfettered One!” I have included some translations of Indian
songs as sung by native singers, because I thought they might be of
interest from an indigenous point of view. Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy, of
the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Mass., is responsible for their English
rendering. The one commencing “Quietly come, O Beauty, come,” has a
mystical meaning. We drift then into the Punjab, the Land of Five
Waters, and find Puran Singh, the Sikh poet, breathing the musk of
God-love through nostrils ever open to receive a spiritual fragrance.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ind">“The dew is falling everywhere,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And wet is every rose.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The gentle breath of heaven blows.”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">It blows the perfume of the Beauty that is Worship into the heart of
this devout enthusiast. His mind is a casket that holds the most
precious gems of the Sikh religion and ideals, and gives<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_14">{14}</a></span> them forth to
an unenlightened world. Nanak, Gobind, Teg Bahadur, the names of the Ten
Masters (whose lives he has written) sound in his ears day and night.</p>

<p>The loneliness of exile rings through the quivering poems of Manmohan
Ghose.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ind">“Lost is that country, and all but forgotten<br></span>
<span class="i0">’Mid these chill breezes ...”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">All true poets love trees; Manmohan Ghose is no exception:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ind">“Willow sweet, willow sad, willow by the river,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Taught by pensive love to droop, where ceaseless waters shiver.”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Pankajini Basu is represented by one poem, “Basanta Panchami,” a
description of the famous Spring Festival. One line, in particular,
stands out: “Ever sorrowful, ever ill-starred, are we women of Bengal,
all of us,” and, one might add, ever devout, ever faithful. The eternal
question of Indian womanhood cannot be dismissed with a shrug of the
shoulders. Mrs. Naidu’s lines:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ind">“What further need hath she of loveliness<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Death hath parted from her lord’s caress?”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">seem to strike at the heart of the matter. Time alone will solve a
problem which at the moment is very vexed indeed. It would seem almost
that in their poems these Indian women express all the fullness of their
hearts in love-songs, hymns of conjugal devotion, lamentations, praise
of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_15">{15}</a></span> physical beauty, and tributes of faith. Emotional outlets of warm,
loyal natures, yet always with the underlying sadness that is the
birthright of Hind, like an anthem at evening or the eyes of a convent
sister. Melancholy glides like pearly vapour through “The Island Grave”
of Sri Aurobindo Ghose:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ind">“And I will meet thee in that lonely place,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then the grey dawn shall end my hateful days<br></span>
<span class="i0">And death admit me to the silent ways.”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">Death, to the Oriental, is a small and yet a great matter. He welcomes
rather than fears it. The body, being but the shell of the soul, is of
little account, save, perhaps, for its procreative value as a creator of
further beings in the image of God. Death, then, is a joyful thing, and
there is but a thin line between the wedding-song and the funeral dirge.</p>

<p>The blue bird of truth is flying against a sky of such intense blueness
as to be almost indistinguishable&mdash;Ananda Acharya’s “blue of Indra.”
This poet sends his “snow-blossoms” of Indian thought forth from the
cool earth of Norway. He lives there amid his “Arctic Swallows,” and in
his later work has grafted Asian feeling, in a curious way, upon a shoot
of Scandinavian origin. There is, of course, a strange affinity between
the Nordic peoples and the Asian. The strain flowed through Northern
Russia, south to Persia, and thence into India,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_16">{16}</a></span> the type gradually
changing from blue-eyed, fair-skinned folk to olive skins and “flaming
eyes, like thunder skies. So deep and dark....”</p>

<p>Jehangir Jivaji Vakil’s three little poems have not hitherto been
published. The one commencing “O long black hair of love” has an almost
Japanese brevity, and compresses into four lines quite a wealth of
ardent feeling.</p>

<p>India is rich in legendary history and does not lack for romantic and
dramatic episodes in her actual chronicles. I have, nevertheless, found
little of the narrative style of poetry among the modern poets.
Historical and legendary references are occasionally met with, but they
are usually incidental, and little use has been made of a
richly-equipped storehouse. Adi K. Sett has utilised this method in
“Roshanara,” Inayat Khan in “Tansen,” and Tagore (in a measure) in
“Urvasi.” Apparently the lyrical style or the sonnet-form has the
greatest appeal.</p>

<p>Narayan Vaman Tilak was a Christian mystic. His poems breathe all the
fervour of the convert.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ind">“Saith Dasa, Christ, upon Thy pallet-bed<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grant me a little space to lay my head.”<br></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">I have included Zahir, Ghalib, and Amir, because, though not modern in a
strict sense, as is, say, Fredoon Kabraji, they have been translated by
living people, namely, Mrs. J. D. Westbrook and Pir-o-Murshid Inayat
Khan.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_17">{17}</a></span></p>

<p>Whether this is the dawn-time of a new era of Indian poetic thought, who
shall say? These Eastern singers, Bengali, Punjabi, Hindu, Mohammedan,
Sikh, Christian, have upon their shoulders a yoke of heavy
responsibility. They have to support and become worthy of the mighty
tradition that lies behind them. Song should be theirs naturally, but it
is one thing to preserve the metre in their own particular tongues and
another to wrestle with the technicalities of English. There are many
more modern poets in India from whom I might have chosen, but the scope
of the book forbids the inclusion of more material.</p>

<p>The Indian twilight descends, gentle and swift, “wizard clocks ring out
and rend the calm.” The dark rich blue of night, peridot-studded, swings
a baby-moon high above inky palm and gleaming tomb. The poet sits in
contemplation. “The lotus dreams upon the lyric melodies of day....”</p>

<span class="i0">I am tyrannous, I have done many a wrong to myself,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I have nourished a flame in my bosom,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A flame that seized the furniture of judgment,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Mine eye fell to weeping, like dew,<br></span>

<span class="i0">When the world-illuming sun rushed upon Night like a brigand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My weeping bedewed the face of the rose,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My tears washed away sleep from the eye of the narcissus,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My passion wakened the grass and made it grow.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Gardener taught me to sing with power,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He sowed a verse and reaped a sword.<br></span>
<span class="i0">In the soil he planted only the seed of my tears,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And wove my lament with the garden, as warp and woof.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tho’ I am but a mote, the radiant sun is mine:<br></span>
<span class="i0">Within my bosom are a hundred dawns.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My dust is brighter than Jamshid’s cup,<br></span>
<span class="i0">It knows things that are yet unborn in the world.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My thought hunted down and slung from the saddle a deer<br></span>
<span class="i0">That has not yet leaped forth from the covert of non-existence.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fair is my garden ere yet the leaves are green:<br></span>
<span class="i0">Full-blown roses are hidden in the skirt of my garment.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I struck dumb the musicians where they were gathered together,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I smote the heartstrings of all that heard me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_28">{28}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Because the lute of my genius hath a rare melody:<br></span>
<span class="i0">Even to comrades my song is strange.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I am born in the world as a new sun,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I have not learned the ways and fashions of the sky:<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not yet have the stars fled before my splendour,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not yet is my quicksilver astir;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Untouched is the sea by my dancing rays,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Untouched are the mountains by my crimson hue.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The eye of existence is not familiar with me;<br></span>
<span class="i0">I rise trembling, afraid to show myself.<br></span>
<span class="i0">From the East my dawn arrived and routed Night,<br></span>
<span class="i0">A fresh dew settled on the rose of the world.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I am waiting for the votaries that rise at dawn:<br></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, happy they who shall worship my fire!<br></span>
<span class="i0">I have no need of the ear of To-day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I am the voice of the poet of To-morrow.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My own age does not understand my deep meanings;<br></span>
<span class="i0">My Joseph is not for this market.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I despair of my old companions,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My Sinai burns for sake of the Moses who is coming.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their sea is silent, like dew,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But my dew is storm-ridden, like the ocean.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My song is of another world than theirs:<br></span>
<span class="i0">This bell calls other travellers to take the road.<br></span>
<span class="i0">How many a poet after his death<br></span>
<span class="i0">Opened our eyes when his own were closed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And journeyed forth again from nothingness<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_29">{29}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">When roses blossomed o’er the earth of his grave!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Albeit caravans have passed through this desert,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They passed, as a camel steps, with little sound.<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I am a lover: loud crying is my faith:<br></span>
<span class="i0">The clamour of Judgment Day is one of my minions.<br></span>
<span class="i0">My song exceeds the range of the chord,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I do not fear that my lute will break.<br></span>
<span class="i0">’Twere better for the waterdrop not to know my torrent,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose fury should rather madden the sea.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No river will contain my Oman:<br></span>
<span class="i0">My flood requires whole seas to hold it.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Unless the bud expand into a bed of roses,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Wrestle with my sea, if thou art a plain;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Receive my lightning, if thou art a Sinai.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Fountain of Life hath been given me to drink,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I have been made an adept of the mystery of Life.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The speck of dust was vitalised by my burning song:<br></span>
<span class="i0">It unfolded wings and became a firefly.<br></span>
<span class="i0">No one hath told the secret which I will tell<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or threaded a pearl of thought like mine.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come, if thou wouldst know the secret of everlasting life!<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_30">{30}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Come, if thou wouldst win both earth and heaven!<br></span>
<span class="i0">The old <i>Guru</i> of the Sky taught me this lore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot hide it from my comrades.<br></span>
<span class="i0">O Saki! arise and pour wine into the cup,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Clear the vexation of Time from my heart!<br></span>
<span class="i0">The sparkling liquor that flows from Zemzem&mdash;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Were it a beggar, a king would pay homage to it.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It makes thought more sober and wise,<br></span>
<span class="i0">It makes the keen eye keener,<br></span>
<span class="i0">It gives to a straw the weight of a mountain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to foxes the strength of lions.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It causes dust to soar to the Pleiades<br></span>
<span class="i0">And a drop of water swell to the breadth of the sea.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It turns silence into the din of Judgment Day,<br></span>
<span class="i0">It makes the foot of the partridge red with blood of the hawk.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Arise and pour pure wine into my cup,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pour moonbeams into the dark night of my thought,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That I may lead home the wanderer<br></span>
<span class="i0">And imbue the idle looker-on with restless impatience;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And advance hotly on a new quest<br></span>
<span class="i0">And become known as the champion of a new spirit;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And be to people of insight as the pupil to the eye,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sink into the ear of the world, like a voice;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And exalt the worth of Poesy<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sprinkle the dry herbs with my tears.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_31">{31}</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Inspired by the genius of the Master of Rum,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I rehearse the sealed book of secret lore.<br></span>
<span class="i0">His soul is the source of the flames,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I am but as the spark that gleams for a moment.<br></span>
<span class="i0">His burning candle consumed me, the moth;<br></span>
<span class="i0">His wine overwhelmed my goblet.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Master of Rum transmuted my earth to gold<br></span>
<span class="i0">And clothed my barren dust with beauty.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The grain of sand set forth from the desert,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That it might win the radiance of the sun.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I am a wave, and I will come to rest in his sea,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That I may make the glistening pearl mine own.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I who am drunken with the wine of his song<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will draw life from the breath of his words.<br></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas night: my heart would fain lament,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The silence was filled with my cries to God.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I was complaining of the sorrows of the world<br></span>
<span class="i0">And bewailing the emptiness of my cup.<br></span>
<span class="i0">At last mine eye could endure no more,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Broken with fatigue it went to sleep.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There appeared the Master, formed in the mould of Truth,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who wrote the Koran of Persia.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He said, “O frenzied lover,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Take a draught of love’s pure wine.<br></span>

<p>All my guilt of old, sin upon sin, put far, far away. Give, O Lord, give
in my heart the melody of a new song.</p>

<p>To stir to life my withered, unfeeling heart, near to death and poor,
play thy melody on the <i>bīnā</i>, taking ever a new tune.</p>

<p>As in Nature thy sweetness overflows, so let thy compassion wake in my
heart.</p>

<p>In the midst of all things may thy loving face float before my eyes. May
no rebel thought against thy wish ever wake in my heart.</p>

<p>Day by day, before I set foot in life’s forest, may I crave thy blessing
and so advance, my Lord.</p>

<p>Setting thy commands upon my head, may I with unfaltering care
accomplish my every task in the remembrance of thy feet.</p>

<p>Giving to thee the fruit of my task fulfilled, at the end of day may my
wearied spirit and body find rest.</p>

<p>Hurrying have I come from far away, knowing thee compassionate. A
hundred hindrances there were to my coming. How many thorns fill the
path to my goal. So, to-day, behold! my heart is wounded, my life is
dark. Hurrying have I come from far away, knowing thee compassionate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_48">{48}</a></span></p>

<p>Open thou thy door of mercy. My raft of life drifts on the boundless
ocean. Fearlessness art thou, and ever powerful. Nought have I, I am
weak and poor. My heart is thirsting for thy lotus feet. The day is now
far spent. Open thou thy door of mercy. My raft of life drifts on the
boundless ocean.<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<h2><a id="THE_DANCER"></a>THE DANCER</h2>

<p>Lo! the heavy rain has come! With loosened tresses densely dark, lo! the
sky is covered. Lightnings rend the thick darkness over the mountains.
All around, to my heart’s content, I see that beauty has burst forth.</p>

<p>See, frolicsome, she pours forth her loveliness in a thousand streams!
Her raiment, hastily flung around her in disarray, mad passion in her
eyes, with the voice of the <i>pāpiyā</i>, full of sweetness and pity, she
sings.</p>

<p>Slowly move her feet. Slipping, slipping, falls her loosely hanging
scarf. Her heart throbs with tumultuous feeling. As if a flood of beauty
overflows, her green jacket of emerald grass displays the hue of her
radiant beauty all around.</p>

<p>The anklets on her feet, keeping time, ring out<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_49">{49}</a></span> in swift succession, as
if they were sweet cymbals. Round her lovely throat hangs her chain of
emerald parrots. The rain has ceased and she garbs herself in silken
robes broidered with diamond raindrops.</p>

<p>She gladdens the eye. On the treetops birds play on golden tambourines.
Is the dancer dancing in Indra’s hall, casting restless glances here and
there? Urbasī<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> puts off the chain of jewels from her breast.</p>

<p>How gay her laughter! How fair a dance her tinkling footsteps weave! Her
bracelets and bangles circle glittering. She is girdled with melody of
murmuring swans. For her earth and sky swoon away, overflowing with
love.</p>

<p>Her hands touched the <i>bīnā</i><a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and by her spell enthralled my
infatuated heart. Tears stream from my eyes; infatuation floods my
heart. The witch to-day has melted my timid heart. Lo! the heavy rain
has come.</p>

wiped away with my <i>sārī</i> end thy tears of grief. O my lord, I know that

worn raiment, and with new jewels, see, with fresh buds and new shoots
she has begemmed herself and smiles. The birds wing their way, singing
with joy; ah, how lovely! The black bee hums as if with sound of “Ulu!
ulu!” he wished good fortune to Nature. The south breeze seems to say as
it flits from house to house, “To-day Bīnāpāni<a id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> comes here to
Bengal.” Arrayed in guise that would enrapture even sages, maid Nature
has come to worship thy feet, O propitious one! See, O India, at this
time all pay no heed to fear of plague, famine, earthquake; all put away
pain and grief and gloom; to-day all are drunk with pleasure. For a year
Nature was waiting in hope for this day to come. Many folk in many a
fashion now summon thee, O white-armed one;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_54">{54}</a></span> I also have a mind to
worship. Thy two feet are red lotuses; but, say, with what gift shall we
worship thee, O mother Bīnāpāni? Ever sorrowful, ever ill-starred are we
women of Bengal, all of us. Yet if thou have mercy, this utterly
dependent one will worship thee with the gift of a single tear of
devotion shed on thy lotus feet. Graciously accept that, and in mercy, O
white-armed one, grant this blessing on my head on this propitious,
sacred day, that this life may be spent in thy worship, Mother.</p>

<p>Râjhans! The Golden Swan! Is it thy plumage that shines, or the sunrise
on the eternal snows?</p>

<p>The dweller of <i>Mân-Sarôwar</i>, the lake on the roof of the world! Thy
golden beak parts milk from water, in the living stream thou art a
liberated soul!</p>

<p>A rosary of spotless pearls is in thy beak, and how sublime is the lofty
curve of thy neck against the Heaven’s vast azure!</p>

<p>Thou livest on pearls, the nectar drops so pure of Hari Nam.</p>

<p>Great Soul! lover of the azure transparent Infinite! Thou canst not
breathe out of the <i>Mân-Sarôwar</i> air, nor canst thou live out of sight
of those loftiest peaks of snow, and away from the diluted perfume of
musk blowing from the wild trail of the deer!</p>

<p>Thou art the spirit of Beauty, thou art far<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_90">{90}</a></span> beyond the reach of human
thought. Thy isolation reflecteth the glory of the starry sky in thy
Nectar Lake of Heart in whose waters the sun daily dips himself!</p>

<p>Thou hast the limitless expanse of air, the companionship of fragrant
gods,</p>

<p>And yet we know thou leavest those Fair Abodes to come to share the woes
of human love;</p>

<p>Thou alightest unawares on the grain-filled barn of the humble farmer,
awakening Nature’s maiden hearts, thou informest love.</p>

<p>It is thy delight to see woman love man, the small ripplings of a human
heart in love flutter thee in thy lofty seat.</p>

<p>Thou art the soul liberated through love; thou knowest the worth of
love, flying for its sake even midst the cities’ smoke and dust,
perchance, to save a human soul through love!</p>

courtesan and dancing-girl at the court of Indra, King of the Gods. Her
adventures were many; she was often sent to lure sages aside from their
devotions, lest they obtained super-divine powers and threatened the
dominion of the Gods (see stanza 4). But in Tagore’s poem she is very
much more than her legendary character. The poem is a tangle&mdash;Indian
mythology, modern science, European romance. She is the cosmic spirit of
life, in the mazes of its eternal dance; she is Beauty dissociated from
all human relationships; she is that world-enchanting Love which (though
not in Dante’s sense) “moves the sun and other stars,” is Lucretius’s
<i>hominum divumque voluptas, Alma Venus</i>, is Swinburne’s “perilous
goddess,” “sea-foam-born.”
</p><p>
I have adopted a quasi-metrical form which I hope will indicate the
general outline of the stanza in which this magnificent ode is written.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> When the Gods churned the Ocean, to recover the lost nectar
of immortality, Urvasi first appeared, one of many good and bad things
that came to light. With the nectar came out poison, which threatened
the life of all creatures, till Siva drank it to save the worlds. Tagore
has invented Urvasi’s responsibility for the nectar and poison being
brought forth; at any rate, I know of no other authority for line 4 of
this stanza.</p></div>
